# Introduction

A server side implementation of @valkyr/ledger

## Configuration

As with all @valkyr packages we consume a fixed .env configuration. This allows for a uniform global approach to retrieving configuration across multiple packages.

Configuration available to ledger is as follows:

```
LEDGER_DB_NAME=
LEDGER_DB_URI=
```
