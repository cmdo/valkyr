## Introduction

`@valkyr/react` provides a simple way to separate your application's logic from its rendering by creating a view controller which defines logic and consumes a view which gets injected with the controllers state and actions.

## Install

Install by using your favorite package manager.

```shell
$ npm i --save @valkyr/react
```

## Disclaimer

This package is still in a experimental state and may be discontinued in the future. It also serves as a proof of concept and trying to establish some approach to the way we personally prefer to work with data and views.

No performance or memory optimizations have been made yet.
